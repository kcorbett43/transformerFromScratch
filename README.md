## ðŸš€ Overview

This project implements the core pieces of a vanilla Transformer from scratch in PyTorch. The end goal is a minimal-yet-complete encoder/decoder stack you can train on small datasets, then extend toward larger language-model experiments.

- `transformer.ipynb` â€“ the main notebook where the model is built step-by-step.
