## ðŸš€ Overview

This project aims to implement the transformer and attention network described in the "Attention Is All You Need" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) paper. The attention network and transformer architecture led to the vast advancements in machine learning that we see today and this project will dive into the fundamentals of these breakthroughs.

- `transformer.ipynb` â€“ the main notebook where the model is built step-by-step.
